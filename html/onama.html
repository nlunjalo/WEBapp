	Synthwave (also called outrun, retrowave and futuresynth) is a genre of electronic music[2] influenced by 1980s film soundtracks and video games.Beginning in the mid 2000s, the genre developed from various niche communities on the Internet, reaching wider popularity in the early 2010s.In its music and cover artwork, synthwave engages in retrofuturism, emulating 1980s science fiction, action, and horror media, sometimes compared to cyberpunk.It expresses nostalgia for 1980s culture, attempting to capture the era's atmosphere and celebrate it.</p>
	
	<p>Musically, synthwave is heavily inspired by many 1980s films, video games, and cartoons,as well as composers such as John Carpenter, Vangelis, and Tangerine Dream. The subgenre name "outrun" comes from the 1986 driving arcade game Out Run, which was known for its soundtrack that could be selected in-game.According to musician Perturbator (James Kent), the style is mainly instrumental, and often contains 1980s cliché elements in the sound such as electronic drums, gated reverb, analog synthesizer bass lines and leads, all to resemble tracks from that time period.</p>

	<p>This aesthetic has been incorporated into retro themed movies and video games featuring synthwave artists. According to Bryan Young of Glitchslap, one of the most notable examples of this is Power Glove's soundtrack to the 2013 video game Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.</p>
