			<h2>HTML5: Where the core web technology is headed now</h2></a>
			<p class="description">
			
		<p>
		HTML5 began making waves in software development many years before its official adoption in October 2014, reducing reliance on proprietary rich internet technologies such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight. The HTML5 video element, for embedding video in a document, was a big change to support the rich internet. HTML5 also was designed to the support the change of the web from a place to browse documents to a place to build distributed applications. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Still dogging HTML5, though, is the search for a common, royalty-free video codec for the web. There has been some progress, but no resolution. H.265 is still encumbered with patents. Google’s VP9 codec may help, but other companies involved in web standards are leery of supporting technology from a major competitor.
		</p>
		<p>
		Nonetheless, HTML5 has established itself as the way to build applications for an open, multimedia-rich web. “HTML5 has very quickly become the only version of HTML that people are really using in browsers today and websites,” said Jeff Jaffe, CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, which has jurisdiction over the technology.
		</p>
		<h4>HTML5’s incremental improvements</h4>
		<p>
		The HTML5 specification is regularly updated. Sometimes, there are small feature improvements and bug fixes, such as with last year’s version 5.1, which modified the canvas 2D element and further cleaned up HTML5.
		</p>
		<p>
		Next up is version 5.2, with features such as, tentatively, the menu element, representing a group of commands that can be activated. Release 5.2 also hones in on Web Content Security Policy, providing a way for developers to control resource access. The upgrade also could handle email addresses in non-Latin alphabets. Still, HTML5.2 is considered a minor revision.
		</p>
		<p>
		But the W3C wants more frequent updates of the core HTML specification, updating it every year instead of every ten to 15 years as in previous HTML major-version shifts, which does not keep up with web time, Jaffe said. However, those major revisions won’t necessarily get whole-number upgrades, such as from HTML5 to HTML6 to HTML7.
