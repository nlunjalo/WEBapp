        <p>HTML 5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current major version of the HTML standard, and subsumes XHTML. It currently exists in two standardized forms: HTML 5.2 intended primarily for Web content developers; and HTML Living Standard intended primarily for browser developers. There are minor conflicts between the two groups' specifications.</p>
		<br>
		<p>HTML 5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as Web browsers, parsers, etc. and to remain backward-compatible with older software.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content, the new <strong>video, audio and canvas</strong> elements were added, and support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) content and MathML for mathematical formulas. To enrich the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements such as <strong>main, section, article, header, footer, aside, nav,</strong> and <strong>figure</strong> are added.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000.
		
		The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) workshop in June 2004,focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible with existing browsers. Immediately after the workshop, WHATWG was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications 1.0, was also announced.The two specifications were later merged to form HTML 5.The HTML 5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007.</p>
