		<h3>About our music - What is SynthWave ?</h3>
		<p>Synthwave <i>(also called outrun, retrowave, or futuresynth)</i> is a genre of electronic music influenced by 1980s film soundtracks and video games. Beginning in the mid 2000s, the genre developed from various niche communities on the Internet, reaching wider popularity in the early 2010s. In its music and cover artwork, synthwave engages in retrofuturism, emulating 1980s science fiction, action, and horror media, sometimes compared to cyberpunk.It expresses nostalgia for 1980s culture, attempting to capture the eras atmosphere and celebrate it.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Synthwave was inspired by many 1980s films, video games, and cartoons, as well as composers such as John Carpenter, Vangelis, and Tangerine Dream. However the genre itself arose from electronic dance music genres including house, synth, and nu-disco.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The subgenre name <strong>"outrun"</strong> comes from the 1986 driving arcade game <strong><i>Out Run</i></strong>, which was known for its soundtrack that could be selected in-game. According to our musician and artist <strong> Perturbator </strong> <i>(James Kent)</i>, the style is mainly instrumental, and often contains 1980s clichéd elements in the sound such as electronic drums, gated reverb, and analog synthesizer bass lines and leads (Synthwave artists and producers typically use vintage equipment from the early/mid 1980s, as opposed to sampled sounds) - all to resemble tracks from that time period. This aesthetic has been incorporated into retro themed movies and video games featuring synthwave artists.</p>
